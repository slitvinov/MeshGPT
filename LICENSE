2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1 Grants 
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions for Non-Commercial purposes only, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6 Fair Use 
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7 Conditions 
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

3.1 Distribution of Source Form 
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License and include a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2 Distribution of Executable Form 
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available as described in Section 3.1 in Source Code Form including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License and include this license, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License. In any case, you must inform the recipients about the Initial Contributor providing the Covered Software under the terms of this License (we recommend the use of a notice like that in Exhibit A).

3.3 Distribution of a Larger Work 
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. 
3.4 Modifications
(a) You may modify Covered Software, if you cause all Modifications to be supplemented by a file documenting the differences between the Covered Software and the Modifications and the date of the creation of any Modification. You must include a prominent statement that any Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Covered Software provided by the Contributor and including the name of the Contributor in (i) the Source Code Form, and (ii) in a notice according to Exhibit A in an Executable Form or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software.

(b) You are obliged to provide this documentation supplementing your Modifications and the Covered Software including your Modifications to the Contributor of the Covered Software as specified in the notices according to Exhibit A irrespective of any distribution of the Covered Software. You may provide this information and code directly to the Contributor via email or another accepted electronic distribution mechanism. 

3.5 Notices 
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation 

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1 The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice and inform the Contributor of Your compliance.

5.2 If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty 

Covered Software is provided under this License basically free of charge in a development status and on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the interaction and performance of the Covered Software is with You. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability
 
Any Contributor shall only be liable for damages other than those resulting from the detriment to life, body and health to the extent such damages arise from willful misconduct, gross negligence or the culpable violation of a fundamental contractual obligation on the part of the Contributor or its vicarious agents. Any further liability for damages shall be excluded, especially liability for the loss of data and the recovery of this data if this loss could have been avoided by You through appropriate precautionary measures, in particular by creating daily backups of all data. The provisions of the German Product Liability Act and other mandatory legal statutes shall remain unaffected.

8. Litigation 

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in courts of the German jurisdiction and such litigation shall be governed by German law. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License

10.1 New Versions 
Audi AG is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

10.2 Effect of New Versions 
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

10.3 Modified Versions 
If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
